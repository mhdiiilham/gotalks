## What Is TDD?

Test-Driven Development (or TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

<strong>TL;DR write your tests before writing the code they are meant to test.</strong>

## Process of TDD

1. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">RED</span>: Create a unit test and fail it.
2. <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold">GREEN</span>: Make the test case pass.
3. <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">BLUE</span>: Change the code to remove duplicate/redundancy.

## Benefits of using TDD

1. Easier To Refactor.
2. High Test Coverage.
3. Make Collaboration Easier.

And there should be more benefits of using TDD.

## The Three Laws of TDD

Robert C. Martin (“Uncle Bob”) provides a concise set of laws for practicing TDD. Understanding these 3 laws of TDD makes it easier to implement it

1. Write production code only to pass a failing unit test.
2. Write no more of a unit test than sufficient to fail (compilation failures are failures).
3. Write no more production code than necessary to pass the one failing unit test.
